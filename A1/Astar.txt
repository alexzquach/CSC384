Question 1: Suppose you want to use A* and you have a heuristic that may overestimate or underestimate
cost to the goal by as much as 20%. Can you do anything to guarantee the algorithm will find
the optimal solution (if one exists)?

Question 1 Answer:


Question 2: (True or False) Assume you you are playing Lunar Lockout on a board that has three xanadus.
The sum of the Manhattan distances between each xanadu and the exit is an admissible heuristic
for this problem, should you use A-star to solve it.

Question 2 Answer: False, the sum of the manhattan distances between each xanadu and the exit is not an admissible
heuristic.  This is because there will be scenarios where the sum of the manhattan distances will overestimate the cost
to reach the goal (go over the true cost) since getting to the goal in lunar lockout doesn't depend on the manhattan
distance from the goal but instead depends on moves in a straight line until collision with another object.  We can count
the cost of this move in a straight line as 1 which is significantly less than what the manhattan distance measurement of
this same move will give us in some scenarios.  Example, if one of the xanadu's is directly above the goal, 4 blocks away,
its manhattan distance will be 4 but its actual "true" cost would be only 1 because we only need to make 1 move to get to
the goal, if there were a robot allowing it to get to the goal.
