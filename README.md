# CSC384
This repo contains all my work for CSC384, a computer science course offered at the University of Toronto with assignments done mostly in python.

### Course Description - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Theories and algorithms that capture (or approximate) some of the core elements of computational intelligence. Topics include: search; logical representations and reasoning, classical automated planning, representing and reasoning with uncertainty, learning, decision making (planning) under uncertainty. Assignments provide practical experience, in both theory and programming, of the core topics.
